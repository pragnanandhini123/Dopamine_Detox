- Accent color: Muted teal (#80CBC4) to highlight key interactions and rewards, providing a subtle contrast and a sense of achievement.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif for a modern and welcoming feel that supports readability on mobile devices.
- Headline font: 'Belleza' sans-serif, a typeface aligned to fashion, art, and design, and a stylishness that doesn't detract from the app's calm, welcoming aesthetic.
- Use simple, clean icons to represent app features, community posts, and gamification elements, with a focus on clarity and intuitive understanding.
- Incorporate gentle, soothing animations for transitions, rewards, and the dopamine meter, avoiding jarring or distracting movements.
